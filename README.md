            To my angry neighbor,  

            I’m aware you and your associates have been stalking me and my family. Every interaction, threat, and instance of harassment has been documented—via video, flight/drone tracking apps, and GPS logs. I’ve identified multiple people involved, and while I don’t understand your motives, I demand that you stop.  

            I’ve never harmed you. The only "offense" I committed was following someone who’d stalked my wife earlier that day. In return, you tried to run me over and threatened my life (all caught on video). This is beyond irrational.  

            I’m not a bad person. I help others when I can. Your choice to victimize people is your own burden, but I refuse to be part of it. Leave me and my family alone. The stress you’ve caused has derailed my life, including my recovery—relapses triggered by your harassment make it impossible to move forward.  

            Lastly, I’ve avoided involving authorities, but your actions are illegal. A dossier of evidence (including your misuse of resources) has been shared with a family member in federal law enforcement. This isn’t a threat—it’s accountability.  

            Stop. Walk away. Let me rebuild my life.  

            —Your exhausted neighbor
